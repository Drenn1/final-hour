To build this, you'll need the wla-dx assembler from: https://github.com/vhelin/wla-dx

The latest release is v9.6, but I used a relatively recent commit:
https://github.com/vhelin/wla-dx/commit/01f7fd16a111ed2cbb81b4c07ed5e793bff5d6bd

v9.6 may or may not be able to assemble this.

Music was done with xpmck. To modify it you'll need "xpmc" in your path.

Graphics were done with ppm, though this tool is abandoned...
